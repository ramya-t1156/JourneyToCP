# JourneyToCP
JourneyToCP is where I track my competitive programming contest participation and progress. It serves as a record of the coding contests I’ve participated in, the problems I’ve solved, and my overall performance. By tracking my journey, I aim to stay consistent, learn from my mistakes, and improve my problem-solving skills over time.
