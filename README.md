# JourneyToCP

Welcome to my **JourneyToCP**! This repository tracks my journey in competitive programming as I participate in various coding contests. It helps me stay consistent, measure my progress, and improve my skills in problem-solving under time constraints.

## Goals

- **Participate in every contest** to improve my skills and compete in a timed environment.
- **Track my performance**: Record the problems attempted, solutions, and rankings.
- **Learn from each contest**: Analyze mistakes, improve strategies, and learn new techniques for solving problems.

## Repository Structure

Each contest is organized into its own folder, named by the date (e.g., `LeetCode-Contest-2025-03-01`). The folder contains:

- Contest problem descriptions
- My solution code for each problem
- A summary of my performance and ranking
